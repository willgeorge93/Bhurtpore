0,ColH519b,4,2021,7,mobile,Superb real ale pub with good food. ,"I've been coming here for years and introduced many friends to this delightful place. Who wouldn't be impressed by the fantastic range of ales, etc. The service is always friendly but I suspect they are struggling to find experienced staff as our young server seemed out of her depth. However we all have to start somewhere so no criticism of that.My only minor complaint was the curries didn't seem to be quite as good as in the past. We had 4 different curries and they all looked like they were out of the same pan but with a few different flavours added. They were OK, not special although the lamb in mine was beautifully tender. Hope this is just a blip.We travel about 35 miles, to visit this place so if you haven't been give it a visit. Great that we can travel there by train to Wrenbury Station. ",2021.0,7.0

As usual, there is a superb choice of cask ales, which keeps me happy, and it is brought to the table pretty quickly. I had promised myself that I would change my starter, but as usual, I settled for the haddock pancake, which is the nicest starter I have had anywhere.

I had also delivered a birthday cake the day before ready to surprise my wife.I had not been here for about twenty years but the place was recommended to me and I was not disappointed.The restaurant is very clean and you can tell it is well cared for. On the way out we went past the kitchen window and this too was very clean and tidy.The staff were really pleasant and friendly.We had starters and main course from the ala carte menu and specials board. All the dishes looked very nice. I had onion bhajis for my starter which were very tasty and clearly home made. For my main course I had the braised lamb shoulder, chips and fresh vegetables from the specials board, this was so tender that it fell from the bone and was excellent. All the other people in the party also said how nice their meals were.The portion sizes were very good too. We ordered some garlic bread to share between us all with the main course but we left most of this.As we had a birthday cake we did not order desserts. Although the menu did sound very nice.After our meal the waitress (sorry I forgot her name) brought out the birthday cake and started a rendition of happy birthday. My wife then gave all the staff a piece of the cake.The meal was also reasonably priced as for starters, mains and drinks for five people came in at just over £150.Many thanks to the staff both front and back of house for their hard work.I would definitely recommend this place.",2019.0,12.0

17,Richard W,5,2019,12,non-mobile,This Exceptional Pub Truly Is The Cathedral of Beer,"This outstanding inn offers a truly remarkable array of real ales,lagers, gins and whiskies. As a regular who enjoys real ale, the 11 hand pulled pumps offer a kaleidoscope of choice for the discerning beer drinker. As a dark beer drinker I particularly like the fact that there is one pump which is always dispensing a stout or a porter. There is always something interesting on offer to try.Simon & Nicky opened this pub in 1997. The plethora of CAMRA awards that adorn the walls (including Cheshire Pub of the Year 2019) are testament to years of hard work and attention to detail that make The Bhurtpore what it is today. The staff are welcoming, knowledgeable, friendly and offer drinkers and diners alike great service. As well as the traditional pub ambience, they offer a competitively priced menu cooked to a high standard using quality local ingredients to suit all tastes. For those wanting a more formal dining experience there is a dedicated separate Dining Room. This establishment caters for drinkers, diners and larger parties booked in advance.If you like mass produced beer made by volume brewers you may be disappointed. Be open to trying what’s on offer not what your used to. You will be pleasantly surprised, particularly if you give the staff an idea of what you like so they can give you advice on what may be suitable to your taste. If it suits you, I guarantee that like myself you will keep coming back.",2019.0,12.0

If you want an unrivalled choice of cask ales, Belgian beers and whiskies etc. look no further. The cask beers are all at reasonable prices, but I can't speak for the others, as I don't drink them. The meals are consistently good, and comprehensive gluten free options are available. If you like fish, the haddock pancake starter is really good. My wife, who is a coeliac, had a Sunday roast which she really enjoyed. In short, you get superior food, drink and service, for a very reasonable price. ",2019.0,8.0

Overall price reasonable too.Staff were young and friendly, helpful - made a big fuss of our labrador who was perfectly welcome in the back bar and got a biscuit from the jar on the bar.The building itself is fun, lots of smaller rooms opened-out, but quirky rather than a big empty modern building.I'd recommend it.",2019.0,8.0

33,NigelJ380,5,2019,7,mobile,You will not find better. ,"I have done so many reviews of the Bhurtpore, it's difficult to find something different to write, especially when the standards they set are so high. The range of cask ales is legendary, so it is not a problem to find one that suits you. If you can't pick one from the large range on display ( 11 I think), you must be hard to please. The meals are consistently good, with a comprehensive specials board. Again, if you can't find a meal to suit from the menu or specials, you must be really fussy. The haddock pancake starter is a must for me, and the curries are excellent too. The gluten free options are good too.

Other restaurants could learn from this that it is about the enjoyment of the clients and not all about revenue generating as is the case in many places.Service was as good as always and the food was so tasty. All 8 of us had great meals and I'll pick out certain dishes that were especially good.The smoked haddock pancakes were delicious to start and 6 out of 8 had curries for mains. I had the venison curry which was very tasty and fairly hot that resulted in my head leaking!!!Only one of my kids could fit in a sweet!!!All I can say in summary is that this is a good bet for a great meal in a great atmosphere and highly recommended ,2019.0,5.0
36,Tyke23,5,2019,6,mobile,Back to high quality standards of food and real ale,"As a family we have been long term visitors to the Bhurtpore Inn . Our last visit was a few years ago when we had been disappointed by the quality of food and disappointing real ales. We risked a booking for an early evening Sunday meal having booked a table having noticed good reports from both Camra and Trip Advisor. The Bhurtpore was busy and the fond remembered mix of types of real ales were available, including a great dark Atom Odorata Stout (4.2%) from Hull (£3.70) We had a half of that to accompany our food. The menu is the same as we remembered but the impressive range of specials on the chalkboards meant my wife and son had to make two visits to check them out! We ordered a carrot and coriander soup with fresh warm bread as a starter (£5.50) which is well worth the price ( and almost a meal in itself!) . The carrot soup was on a large oval plate with two halves of a large warm crusty bread roll, small dish of croutons and butter. The soup was fresh and tasty with lovely shavings of carrot with the body of the creamy soup.We had ordered different main courses. I had ordered a steak and kidney pie with shortcrust pastry top , a favourite of mine in the past, I was so pleased that it was a quality tasty pie, like I used to order, with lovely steak and kidney underneath a delicious pastry lid. ( £11.50) . My wife ahead a sirloin steak and my son ordered a roast beef meal. We had a huge portion of lovely cooked chips , although we could have ordered several other varieties of potatoes as an accompaniment. We also had a dish of fresh vegetables including cauliflower, carrots and broccoli.The waitress service was friendly and but was clearly under pressure . The request for a glass of table water was forgotten but can be forgiven under the pressure of trying to serve so many people with a myriad of complex orders. It is a restful place to eat and drink and we are so glad we called in again .. we shall return !",2019.0,6.0

39,kernowwizard,5,2019,5,non-mobile,An amazing pub,"I have reviewed this pub some time ago and I am pleased to report that it is still a great pub. The range of beers, wines and spirits is amazing. A lot of the beers are guest beers, but on a very large board is the name of the beer, its strength, its price and a brief note about it. Study the board then confuse yourself by looking at the numerous ciders. Order a beer and then keep looking. You could if you have the time, be there for a long time!!Now then, the food. The menu is not vast but there is a good choice and it is very good. Take a look at the Specials Board even more excellent dishes and then if like me there is another board to check out - Yes, it is curries. These are not your usual pub curries, these are authentic and equal anything you are likely to get in top class Indian restaurant.So, do book a table, get there at least 30 mins before your table time, check out the beers etc. Check out the Specials, then sit at your table, check out the main menu and then make your decision.

We have a small well-behaved dog with us; because of that we were banished to a room in the 2nd extension (the building has been extended several times) about as far away from the bar as we could be. Completely lacking in atmosphere - basically like eating in a cafe.Had sausage egg & chips from the ""small meals"" menu - at £7,50 it was a rip-off. 3 small sausages, a watery fried egg, and a handful of frozen chips was it. 2 of us had the chicken curry - slightly better but still unpleasant looking and smelling strongly of cumin.This used to be a really interesting place; now not worth the trip with so much else in the area.",2019.0,3.0

Had a few drinks (great selection of everything especially real ales of which there must be 10 or 12 on the blackboard). The pub is renowned for curries. I think the owner Simon makes them. The choice of curries is just superb. The quality is in my opinion better than any Indian/Bangladeshi/Pakistani restaurant. In the past I've had beef madras or a venison curry they do but today we had a mince lamb with bitter gourd which was divine. Such a nice taste and I liked the authentic touch of the bitter gourd. Think that one was called Keema Karella . And we also had a chicken Tamil dish which was lovely. The flavours are spot on. I could eat those curries every day. I only pop in once a month or couple of months if I'm lucky as I don't live so close now but it's a lovely pub. I first went in 1997 when Simon took over (approx?) and the pub has grown out over the years but it's still as good as ever. I can't drink as much as I used to but it's still a great place to wile away the Sunday afternoon. We even got to watch England finish off South Africa in the cricket before listening to a few songs from the band. You get a nice crowd in here whom I prefer to elsewhere. ,2017.0,7.0

The sea bass was such a light dish whereas the pig cheeks melted in your mouth in a rich red wine sauce. The desserts were also mouthwatering.

I adopted for goat curry, whilst the other half had a minty lamb one.We both had the Indian starters served with chutney an yogurt dips.The starters were excellent. The mains were served with a bowl of basmati rice, and a poppadom each.In honesty my dish was a little to salty for my taste, but a spoonful of Debby's proved this feature to be restricted to mine.

The interior of the pub is very much traditional pub style with the some modern extensions and has a terrific selection of ales although I wasn't able to sample these as I was driving. I ordered the bacon and mozzarella burgers from the specials board which was very tasty although the accompanying chips could have been crispier. However my wife's duck breast with cabbage in plum sauce was a disappointment. The duck breast was overcooked and largely flavourless and the plum sauce was more akin to a red wine sauce with too much off it and lacking the punchy sweet flavour of a good plum sauce. The cabbage was good but there was too little of it. The accompanying veg were at least well cooked and still had bite.

It’s one of those places where you feel comfortable as soon as you walk up to the bar. Great atmosphere and the landlord/barman was extremely welcoming and friendly. With 11 cask ales on the board there was no doubt we’d have to make another visit, although we could have happily stayed all afternoon!The Bhurtpore doesn’t appear very big from outside but it’s deceptively spacious. There are a number of rooms running around a central bar area – one has a pool table and TV showing sports (not too obtrusive), one is more of a general bar area and then there are areas for dining. Somehow it’s all quite relaxing and cosy.Long story short, we booked for nine of us to go for a meal the next evening. The welcome was just as warm and the landlord/barman couldn’t have been more helpful.We got to sample more great beers and there was also a small range of craft lagers on draught – not to mention the extensive range of gins and the list of ciders!The choice of food was just as good and it was very difficult to make a choice from the main menu and the specials boards.

Every time I go, I promise myself that I will have a different starter, but I always have the smoked haddock pancake, which is wonderful. Another 'plus' is the fact that there is a good amount of time between courses, which we all like, but which may be a bit offputting if you're a fast food buff. One slight gripe - my niece's dessert got forgotten somehow, and arrived as the rest of us were finishing ours, but I'm certainly not going to dock any stars for that, as the standard is always so high, and everyone makes mistakes.

The food experience is another story and I would not go to the Bhurtpore for the food. The lasagne was dry and cremated. The curries on which the Bhurtphore prides itself all look the same with no discernable ingredients apart from the meat, I suspect it is the same curry with the 'heat' adjusted by spoons of chilli powder, do not expect an Indian restaurant experience.

The selection of beers is epic; they're started putting little kilner jars of the beer next to the pump so you can see how dark (or pale) the beers are. If you like real ales, you'll be in heaven, but there is enough variety to make it interesting for anyone; Bitburger pilsner is really good and in winter there are things like mulled cider.There's a specials board as well as a regular menu. Kids can order from the light bites section of the latter. We often have something more unusual from the specials menu.I usually have a curry and they're often better than I've had in some curry houses (obviously not the Naaz, but that's another review). The heat guide is usually pretty accurate, so their Madras is pretty challenging for me, but packed with flavour. This time I had Mutton and it was excellent. My wife had beef and stilton pie, which had a cheesy pie crust. Our daughter had fish goujons and I didn't get a look in there. My mother-in-law had some pork thing which was admittedly a bit average, but then it wasn't my meal, so I was happy!I'd say that it's a bit of a man's pub, except that my wife prefers it to many of the other local pubs.

We arrived at 7pm and there were already plenty of customers probably due to the fact it is a real ale pub. Our friends arrived and we were given our pre booked table number. It is advisable to book a table for a Saturday night as the restaurant was full. There are plenty of daily specials and a menu of ""normal"" pub food. After ordering our food there was about a 30 minute wait which we thought was fair due to the amount of people. The food arrived,the lasagne was a good portion and was very tasty, the steak cooked as requested and very tender, the fish flaky and the salmon pie went down well. It was all served hot which is very important to myself. The only negative point is that for pub food I thought it was quite expensive, pub food at restaurant prices but other than that a very good evening in friendly surroundings.",2014.0,1.0

During the period of time of the visit, it was my son and daughter-in-law’s Wedding Anniversary so we decided to treat them to a meal and went to The Bhurtpore Inn.This place is amazing! I have never seen so many beers and ciders in one place in my life! OK they were in bottles but they also had 11 different ale’s on tap!I could write a review just about the beers and ciders.Anyway, we checked out the varied set menu and the specials board. I had been told that this place was renowned for its curries. This is an English pub run by an English couple. The only connection with the Indian continent is that the family’s history goes back to the days of the Raj when the landlords great grandparents, if not great, great grandparents where in the British Army in India.Because of this reputation for curries I was a bit concerned as my wife has an allergy to cumin which could be possibly fatal. But she carries an eppipen with her and insisted we go there.When the waitress took the order, the situation re the cumin allergy was explained and we asked that my wife’s food be cooked nowhere near any cumin. My wife, son and daughter-in-law decided on a prawn and crayfish starter and I went for the meat samosa’s. It was all delicious.For the main course my daughter had duck, my wife opted for the sirloin steak, my son with a bit of persuasion from me ordered the hottest curry in the pub called a Lamb Tindaloo and I had a Beef Madras.The waitress came back and said to my wife. “I’m sorry, but you can’t have the chips with your steak because they are cooked in the same oil as the samosa’s. You will have to have salad or boiled potatoes and veg. Now that’s what I call customer care!!When the meals arrived there were three onion rings on my wife’s plate of steak, potatoes and veg and she said “What about the onion rings? Have they been fried in the chip oil”? “Oh no” said the waitress, “they were cooked separately for you”!! Well, that’s another star for customer care!!Was the Tindaloo hot? Oh yes it was steaming!!!! And my Madras was hot but nothing like the Tindaloo. We shared both the dishes which cooled the Tindaloo down a bit, but not much. The one thing that struck us both was we have been in Indian Restaurants and eaten very hot curries before and to be honest they were all heat and not a lot of flavour. Here at the Bhurtpore we had heat and a lot of flavour. It was excellent as were all the starters, the Duck and the Steak.For excellent service, customer care, quality of food, unbelievable choice of beers and ciders and value for money, this place cannot be beaten.",2012.0,9.0

282,Brian W,5,2012,9,non-mobile,Added to my personal list of favourites,"I have wanted to try this place for years, and at last a chance arrived, accompanied by my wife and a friend. It is a tad hard to find if you're a stranger to the area, but the search was definitely worth the effort.First - wonderful choice of real ales. It's a little bit like a miniature beer festival. Obviously one couldn't taste everything, but the pint of bitter I had was in excellent condition, and served at just the right temperature.Now to food. This place specialises in curries, and there are few things I enjoy more. I chose one that was classed as 'medium hot' a Tamil Chicken. It was simply beautiful. However, although I like my curries fairly hot - I usually have Madras in my local curry house - this was about as hot as I would care to go, so I can only think the 'hot' curries are pretty searing and might need lots of drink to go with them. The portion size was above average and very filling. Above all, unlike some pubs which seem to use scrag ends of chicken when making curry, the actual chicken was first class. (This is an obsession of mine - I would always prefer to pay a bit more to get decent quality chicken.)My companions, less curry orientated than me, chose lamb and beef pie respectively from the extensive menu. Both pronounced them excellent. My wife compared the quality to that at the Tempest Arms, Elslack, which from her is the ultimate praise.The price was very reasonable, considering the quality and quantity of the food. This is a definite re-visit, if we are in the area, and probably if we can find half an excuse to pass it.",2012.0,9.0

But this is not a restaurant or even a gastro pub - its a drinkers pub which serves food, albeit not a bad menu with choice of curries and rustic sounding main courses but when the food comes its more like heated up frozen food rather than fresh.

285,woffer73,3,2012,8,non-mobile,I was so expecting more.,"I had heard many extremely favourable reviews of the Bhurtpore Inn at Aston from work colleagues over the years, but for one reason or another, we never got around to visiting. Reviews on Tripadvisor were also extremely favourable, so we decided that we would visit.The setting is in a very picturesque village, called Aston. On entering, the warm atmosphere is instantly gratifying. The variety of wines, beers, and spirits on offer is very impressive. I had one of my favourite wheat beers-Erdinger, and it was excellent. Bar staff were very friendly.Unfortunately, this is where the praise mostly ends. We perused the menu and various specials boards with interest. My Wife and I both ordered the chestnut mushroom soup from the specials board, which we were later informed was sold out. No big deal, so we ordered black pudding in french mustard and apple sauce, and salmon fishcakes with home-made tartar sauce. The black pudding was ok, but the sauce added nothing to the dish at all. My wife's fish cakes were just ok, but the home-made tartar sauce was delicious.As the reviews regarding the curries at the Bhurtpore were so encouraging, i decided to order one, again from the specials board. I opted for the spicy mango chicken, which was served with a poppadom and mango chutney. My wife ordered the gammon and egg, served with home-made chips. I'm not entirely sure how i expected my curry dish to be presented- perhaps in a nice balti dish or the like? What i ended up receiving was a runny curry plonked onto the kind of rice reserved for Uncle Ben, on a plate that wouldn't entirely look out of place on any NHS Hospital ward. I could have forgiven the appalling presentation if the taste of the food compensated for it, but it just didn't. It was borderline insipid. l've made better curries at home, using a jar of Patak's, and some boiled Tilda rice, and i regard myself as a below average cook.Perhaps my Wife would have more success with her gammon and egg? Oh dear. The gammon was like that cheap, overly salty crap that you buy in the supermarkets, that ends up chewy if you leave it in the pan any longer than 30 seconds. The egg was also overcooked, and greasy- fine for a layby greasy spoon, but not for a pub held in such high regard. The home-made chips were, however very good, but did little to assuage our disappointment.The fact that not once did any wait staff approach our table to see if everything was to our liking, only compounded our misery.As a drinking pub, this place would undoubtedly hold it's own with the very best, but based on our recent dining experience, we won't be revisiting any time soon. Such a shame.",2012.0,8.0

288,TVRLady,5,2012,7,non-mobile,A great pub for drinks & food.,A very pleasant free house pub & restaurant. A huge choice of drinks.

291,Brenda S,5,2012,5,non-mobile,Fabulous atmosphere,"I have visited this pub on many occasions - with family and my husband. If we have eaten, the food has always been tasty and good value. The staff are very friendly and have been very accommodating - we contacted them before our visit to explain my daughter's intolerance of gluten and dairy. They made every effort to give her choices and even made her a special dessert - which we all decided we wanted! They specialise in curries and although I have not had one myself, my husband says they are excellent! There are always speciality beers available and do appear to be very popular (not a big fan of beer myself). We will definitely return to The Bhurtpore Inn - just wish we could live in Wrenbury and therefore become a regular.",2012.0,5.0
292,NantwichFlatley,4,2012,4,non-mobile,Great for beer and curry lovers....,".....with a great range of hand pulled ales, continental lagers and fridges full of belgian strong ales you'll always find a satisfying drink at the Bhurtpore. Great place for locals and visitors only a 10min walk from Wrenbury Station. Simon, the landlord, can be seen in a variety of locations either in the cellar or the kitchen - cooking up some fantastice curries from the modest to the SuperTindaloo (have several beers on standby). He's generally only seen behind the bar when Liverpool FC are winning though!Well worth a visit.",2012.0,3.0

298,CheshireMatt,4,2012,1,non-mobile,Good tasty food....particularly the curries!,"Ate here on a Thursday night - the Bhurtpore is pub that does good food in Aston near Nantwich. With lots of space inside and friendly staff it has a varied menu, particularly good curries. You have to try the belgian waffles as they are a definite treat. Plenty of choice of real ales too - so definitely recommended. Not the best in the vicinity of Nantwich as I think the Thatch and Nags Head at Houghton are better but worthy of a meal out any time.",2012.0,1.0
299,CheshireGerMan,5,2011,12,non-mobile,As good as ever,"A wet and windy late-December day. What better way to spend it than with mulled cider, veggie sausage baguettes and delicious hand-cut chunky chips. Good old Bhurtpore!",2011.0,12.0
300,ScooterFoxterrier,5,2011,12,non-mobile,Well worth the drive out,"This is a Pub/Restaurant.The Pub itself always has at least a dozen guest real ales and what seems to be 100's of different european bottled (and some draught) beers. It has won CAMRA pub of the year several time - this in itself speaks volumes.Then there is the food. Again a specials board always shows about a dozen or so main course and starters - all fab! and the desert board, well...................................There is a menu available as well as the specials.All in all, this place is Fab, and the staff are always friendly and helpful, despite reading the reviews below.

302,CheshireGerMan,5,2011,11,non-mobile,If a pub could serve as a template for others...,"The Bhurtpore Inn has something for everyone. The best selection of British and continental beers, craft ciders, an extensive wine cellar, large whisky selection and a super selection of quality food including ever-changing specials featuring local produce. There's a restaurant room, a lounge bar, a public bar (dedicated for drinkers only at busy times), a conservatory and a large beer garden. The beer garden could do with some attention to bring it up to the same standard as the inside of the pub which cannot be criticised. An annual summer beer festival, with occasional winter festivals, sets the standard for events offered by similar establishments. There are only a handful of pubs in the country that can spoke of in similar terms as the Bhurtpore.Some other reviews are critical of the staff but I, my family and my dog have always had a freindly welcome. The staff are also very knowledgebale in terms of the beer and food on offer and are happy to give advice.",2011.0,11.0
